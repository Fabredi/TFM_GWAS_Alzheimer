# TFM_GWAS_Alzheimer
This code has all the steps to do a GWAS analysis using PLINK using .bed .fam and .bid files, then a meta-analysis using METAL and the functional interpretation of the significative genes related to Alzheimer in humans and mice. Includes the QC steps and other filters used in the middle of the process, also doing the modifications that have to be done to the data to work (for example preparing the beginning files to enter PLINK by checking duplicates, ambiguous SNPs or also preparing the output files of PLINK to be able to be used in METAL). It has also the process of enrichment using enrichr and the later testing of functional relationate with Alzheimer. But there are parts that are not included like the anotation of the genes that has been done using Ensembl or the search for orthologous genes in mice (also done with Ensembl).

Important note: The data used is restricted and cannot be shared publicly. Therefore, the code can be consulted in this repository, but it is not possible to run analyses without first requesting access to the data from the relevant entities.
Data used in preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimerâ€™s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.usc.edu).
